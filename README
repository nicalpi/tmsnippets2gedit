This morning I needed to transform textmate snippets bundle into a Gedit format.

I've made this quick and dirty is someone need it.

I'll probably improve it in the future.

*How to use*

Copy your textmate Snippets directory into the tmsnippets2gedit folder, run ruby tmsnippets2gedit.rb

This will convert all you need and create a result.xml file. Edit this file and replace [LANGUAGE] with your language.

*nokogiri*

you'll need nokogiri in order to use this script, so sudo gem install nokogiri

Example to convert cakephp textame to gedit/pluma snippets

git clone https://github.com/jsenin/tmsnippets2gedit
sudo gem install ruby ruby-nokogiri

git clone https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp-tmbundle
cd cakephp-tmbundle
ruby ../tmsnippets2gedit.rb 

sed -i 's/\[LANGUAGE\]/php/g' result.xml
sudo cp result.xml /usr/share/pluma/plugins/snippets/php.xml

or 

sudo cp result.xml ~/.config/pluma/snippets/php.xml
